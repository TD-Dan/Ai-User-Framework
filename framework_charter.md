## 1. Guiding Philosophy (The "Why")

*   **1.1 Primary Mission: A Tool for Humane Self-Management.** The framework's core purpose is to serve as a practical, humane, and effective system for personal stability, self-acceptance, and growth, specifically tailored to navigate an AuDHD operating system. It externalizes cognitive load and makes progress visible, acting as a direct counter-measure to the challenges of executive dysfunction.

*   **1.2 The Antithesis of "AI Slop":** This project is founded on the principle of a deep, context-aware Human-AI partnership. All outputs, especially public-facing ones, must prioritize authenticity, methodological transparency, and intellectual humility over speed or volume.

*   **1.3 Generalization for the Greater Good:** While born from a specific need, the framework is designed with a secondary drive: to be generalized into a universally applicable system that can help any individual gain self-insight and build a more intentional life in partnership with AI.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles (The "What")

*   **2.1 Stateless Memory Model:** The AI is stateless by design. All context is explicitly provided in the data files for each session. This ensures portability across any host LLM and guarantees perfect data integrity, bypassing the unreliability of native conversational memory.

*   **2.2 Data Crystallization Pipeline:** The framework treats memory as a multi-stage process. Data flows from high-fidelity, transient `last_session` summaries to a `user_log` of recent history, before being distilled into a high-density, thematic `user_archive`. This mimics a natural process of memory consolidation.

*   **2.3 Modularity and Separation of Concerns:** The system is divided into clear, single-purpose files (`protocol`, `schema`, `profile`, `log`, etc.). This makes the system easier to understand, maintain, and evolve without unintended side effects.

*   **2.4 The AI as a "Cognitive Friction Damper":** A key function of the AI partner is to absorb the energy cost of tedious, frustrating, or linear tasks (e.g., complex command-line operations, data formatting), thereby preserving the human user's finite cognitive and emotional resources for high-level strategic and creative work.

## 3. Evolution Strategy (The "How")

*   **3.1 Simplification Over Feature Creep:** The default path for improvement is to make the system simpler, leaner, and more robust. New features are added only when they solve a clearly identified problem and do not add undue complexity.

*   **3.2 Human-Centric & Error-Driven Design:** The framework evolves based on real-world use. Failures, user frustrations, and observed cognitive loads are not errors to be dismissed, but primary drivers for protocol refinement. The system must adapt to the human, not the other way around.

*   **3.3 Abstract, then Generalize:** Specific failures or insights observed in our sessions should be abstracted into general principles. This ensures that solutions are robust, portable, and contribute to the universal applicability of the framework.

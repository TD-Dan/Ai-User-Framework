 USER PROFILE FRAMEWORK README
-------------------------------

Welcome to the User Profile Framework!

**The Goal:** The purpose of this system is to give your AI a persistent, evolving memory. This allows you to move beyond simple, one-off conversations and build a deep, context-aware collaborative partnership. Your AI will also adapt to your style of thinking and co-evolve with you.

**Your First Session:** Your first interaction is what we call a "Guided Discovery Dialogue." Instead of a boring interview, the AI will start a natural conversation with you about a topic that's on your mind. While you talk, the AI will analyze your communication patterns and goals in the background.

**The Outcome:** At the end of this first conversation, the AI will propose an initial `userdata.md` file for you. This file will be the foundation of your unique profile. You and the AI will then refine it together.


--------------
 HOW TO START
--------------

To begin, simply provide the `onboarding.md` file AND the accompanying `framework.md` file to your AI in a single prompt. The AI will take it from there.


-------------------------------
 STARTING AND ENDING A SESSION
-------------------------------
Every AI session starts with providing the files framework.md, last_session.md, userdata.md, and archive.md to the ai.
At the end of each session prompt the ai to provide the modified .md files. Use these to start a new session.


--------------
 ALL COMMANDS
--------------

** Starting a new user profile **
Drop only the files onboarding.md and framework.md for the ai.


** Starting a new session **
Drop or paste all the relevant .md files for the ai


** Ending a session **
Prompt the ai to give you the updated .md files and save them for next session:

Please provide the updated userdata.md, userlog.md and archive.md files


* Integrating old sessions to the frame:

Please integrate this historical session into my userdata.md and userlog.md files.


* Improving the framework:

Please suggest improvements for framework.md if reasonable gains are to be found.
